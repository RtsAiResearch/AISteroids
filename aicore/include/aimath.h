 * geometry routines. This file contains an implementation of a three
 * dimensional vector suitable for basic spatial querying. You
 * probably already have a vector implementation, along with other
 * vector mathematics (such as quaternions and matrices), that can be
 * used in place of this. It makes sense to reconfigure the code to
